😀 I’m interested in ...
* Desktop development
* App development

* Database development
* Data science
* Video game development
* Video game scenario development

😒 I’m not as interested in ...
* Board game designing. Two reasons for this. (1) I don't like analog iterative processes as much as digital ones. (2) I don't like how "jigsaw-like" it is. There's all these "pieces" that have to work well together. And if the whole isn't greater than its parts (e.g. the game is too expensive, complicated, time-consuming to play, etc.), you often have to scrap the whole thing since it's all the parts together that don't work well together. Like a puzzle too, the more parts there are, the harder it is to make it a cohesive whole like this is a disjointed mess
