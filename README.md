## Welcome 👋

I'm a student at Flinders University. Studying a Bachelor of software engineering (honours). 

I enjoy working on pet projects. I'm putting on projects I've worked on (and haven't lost the files for 😢. I have, for example, lost files for recreation of Pong in GameMaker with AI or human opponent, special abilities, different levels, and so on from years ago) on GitHub

😒 I’m not as interested in ...
* Board game designing. Two reasons for this. (1) I don't like analog iterative processes as much as digital ones. (2) I don't like how "jigsaw-like" it is. There's all these "pieces" that have to work well together. And if the whole isn't greater than its parts (e.g. the game is too expensive, complicated, time-consuming to play, etc.), you often have to scrap the whole thing since it's all the parts together that don't work well together. Like a puzzle too, the more parts there are, the harder it is to make it a cohesive whole like this is a disjointed mess
