## Welcome üëã

I'm a student at Flinders University. Studying a Bachelor of software engineering (honours). I'm also running a business, "Hopping Forwards" that develops educational software in-house and offers a software consulting service. 

I enjoy working on pet projects. I'm putting on projects I've worked on (and haven't lost the files for üò¢) on GitHub

üòí I‚Äôm not as interested in ...
* Board game designing. Two reasons for this. (1) I don't like analog iterative processes as much as digital ones. (2) I don't like how "jigsaw-like" it is. There's all these "pieces" that have to work well together. And if the whole isn't greater than its parts (e.g. the game is too expensive, complicated, time-consuming to play, etc.), you often have to scrap the whole thing since it's all the parts together that don't work well together. Like a puzzle too, the more parts there are, the harder it is to make it a cohesive whole like this is a disjointed mess
